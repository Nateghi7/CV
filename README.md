- I would like to thank Dr.Razavi Ebrahimi for his kind guidance and instructions.

- Works on different devices based on the resolution.
- Does have a PDF generator.
- Does Include a dark theme for eye harm reduction.

- Please note that PDF Download link is not working on github pages and needs nodeJS (backend) to work properly.
