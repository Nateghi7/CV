# ResponsiveResumeWebsite

This is a responsive Webpage which is a project for my Project/Internship courses.
I would like to thank Dr.Razavi Ebrahimi for his kind guidance and instructions.

Please note that PDF Download link is not working on github pages and needs nodeJS (backend) to work properly.

Used JS , CSS and HTML.
Forked from:
